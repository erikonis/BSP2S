# BSP2S
Repository for storing Summer Bachelor Semester Project files of academic year 24/25. It is a continuation and improved version of BSP2 with a way bigger dataset and better implementation. In addition, this project consists of a system designed to automate code generation using LLMs API from OpenRouter with parallel and linear operation modes.

Project outcome is described in ```BSP2S_paper.pdf``` file.

This repository consists of:
1. results - organized by training mode, specifying all the metrics, graphs and matrices for each model and each training setting (raw or preprocessed).
2. work_tools - separated by categories, each consisting of python codes, used in the project to achieve different aims.

In addition, other project-related files that are not in this repository can be accessed following the links:

- Obtained CNN models (```.pth``` files): https://huggingface.co/erikonis/BSP2S-models
